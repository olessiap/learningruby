=begin
1. In Ruby, everything is an object. Every bit of information and code can be given their own properties and actions.
2. Object-oriented programming calls properties by the name instance variables and actions are known as methods.
3. Ruby features single inheritance only, on purpose. But Ruby knows the concept of modules which are collections of methods
4. A block is a parameter passed into a method
5. use array whenever you need a list of elements in specific order
6. a hash is an unordered collection where data is organized into "key/value pairs"
7. attr_accesor method used to define attributes for instances of a class
8. in Boolean operators, ruby will only evaluate far enough to determine if expression if true or false.
  it will return whatever is returned by the last part of expression to get evauated
9. iterator - ruby method that repeatedly repeats a block of code
10. puts means put string
11. every method is being done by some object even if it doesn't have a dot in front of it.
12. arrays of arrays = multidimensional arrays
13. A hash is a collection of key-value pairs
14. index variable keeps track of which iteration the code is on, or increments until the condition is met
#["rock", "paper", "scissors"].index("paper")
15. objects are created by calling a constructor (special method associated with a class) .new
16. expression interpolation "#{expression}"
17. variable scope = section of code that recognizes it. Variable defined inside a method is only available inside that method.
18. local variable = defined within a method is 'local' to that method
19. return will stop an entire method, whereas
    break will just break out of a loop and continue with the rest of the code in the method.
20. sort! -- exclamation point permanently changes the array rather than making a new copy that is sorted

### BOOLEAN OPERATORS ###

# && AND - true if both expression on either side are TRUE#
#left side must evaluate true, if false, doesn't even go to the second expression

1 < 2 && 2 < 3 # => true

# || OR - true if one of the expressions is true (inclusive or)
#if left side evalutes to true, the right side will not be tried
#bc it has already met the condition of 1 side to be true

true || false # => true

# ! NOT - makes true boolean operators false and vice-versa

!true # => false

(3 < 4 || false) && (false || true) # => true

!true && (!true || 100 != 5**2) # => false

true || !(true || false) # => true

#EXERCISE: replacing "s" strings with "th" #
#extra credit:
#1. additional if statement to re-prompt the user for input if they don't enter anything
#2. plan for words in which the letter "c" sounds like an "s"
#3. preserve the user's original capitalization

=begin
1. get user input (print statement)
2. downcase (to convert user input to lowercase so not to look for both S and s)
3. check for "s"
4. replace "s" with "th"
5. else statment if no S present
6. print out changed string to user
